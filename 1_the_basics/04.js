// Explain why this code logs '510' instead of 15.
// console.log('5' + 10);

// The 5 is a string becaue of the quotations around it. Therefore, we are not adding the number 5 to the number 10. We are using the + operator between a string with the value of '5' and the number 10. Because a string is involved, all elements are turned to strings and concatenated.
